# Web Development
Repository for web development projects
---------------------------------------
Here, I have created stylis, functional, and animated websites. These were made as demo sites following an online course to develop skills in HTML and CSS. After learning the skills hands on while creating these sites, I decided to apply my learning and display them all together by hand coding a web development portfolio.
