# Web Development
Repository for web development projects
---------------------------------------
In this repository I have contained the code to stylish, functional, and animated websites. These were made as demo sites following an online course to develop skills in HTML and CSS. A big thank you to Dev Ed for being a great instructor and walking through learning web development. After learning the skills hands on while creating these sites, I decided to apply my learning and display them all together by hand coding a web development portfolio.
